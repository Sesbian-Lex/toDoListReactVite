# 📝 To-Do List Project

This is a simple To-Do List application built using **React + Vite**. It implements full **CRUD functionality** — allowing users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✅ Edit existing tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete (and move them to a separate list)
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ Restore completed tasks to the active list
- ✅ Task data is **saved in localStorage** to persist across browser sessions

This is my **first React project**, and through it I learned:
- How to use **React hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`
- How to manage state and component interaction
- How to implement **routing** (React Router)
- How to use **localStorage** for persistent client-side storage
- The modular structure and file organization of React projects
